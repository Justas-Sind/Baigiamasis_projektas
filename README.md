# CodeAcademy Final project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to get started

1. Open your terminal and then type

`$ git clone {the url to the GitHub repo}`

The command clones the repo hosted at Github.

2. cd into the new folder and type

`$ npm install`

This command installs the required dependencies.

3. Run the JSON Server script (by default on Port 3000)

`$ npm run jsonServer`

4. Run the React project (on a different port)

`$ npm start`

Aaand its done, you are ready to go!
